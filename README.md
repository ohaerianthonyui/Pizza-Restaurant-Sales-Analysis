### **Recommendations**

Based on the findings, the following recommendations can help Plato’s Pizza optimize sales and operations:

1. **Promote Best-Selling Pizzas**: Focus marketing efforts on the **Thai Chicken Pizza** and **Classic Pizza** category, which are performing well. Consider offering promotions or special deals around these items to drive more sales.
   
2. **Revise the Veggie and XL Pizza Categories**: Investigate why **Veggie** pizzas and **XL** sizes are underperforming. This could be due to customer preferences, pricing, or marketing. Experiment with new ingredients or recipes for the Veggie category to attract more customers.

3. **Target Off-Peak Times**: Sales are low on **Sundays** and **Saturday mornings**. Consider offering promotions or discounts during these times to encourage more orders. For example, you could introduce a **"Weekend Special"** or a **"Sunday Brunch Pizza"** to target these off-peak hours.

4. **Optimize Pricing**: Since there is an inverse relationship between pizza price and quantity sold, consider adjusting prices for higher-end pizzas to make them more accessible, or introduce smaller-sized pizzas at lower price points to cater to different customer preferences.

5. **Ingredient Promotions**: Given the popularity of certain ingredients like **pepperoni** and **mushrooms**, Plato’s Pizza could introduce limited-time pizzas featuring these ingredients to further increase sales. Additionally, experimenting with new toppings and seasonal ingredients may help drive sales in the **Veggie Pizza** category.

6. **Enhance Afternoon Sales**: Given that afternoons, especially on **Thursdays**, are high-volume periods, Plato’s Pizza could offer lunch specials or discounts targeted at customers during these peak hours to boost sales even further.

7. **Review Week 48 Performance**: Week 48 had the highest sales and order volume. Studying the factors that contributed to this success (e.g., promotions, holidays, local events) can provide insights for replicating this performance in future weeks.
